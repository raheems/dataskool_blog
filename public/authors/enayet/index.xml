      <description>Github needs no introduction. If you are unfamiliar with git, its a version control system for tracking changes in computer (programming) codes. &amp;ldquo;GitHub Inc. is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.&amp;rdquo;1
Copying a remote repository to local To bring a remote repository to your local host (computer where you are working), use the git clone command.</description>

      <description>Microsoft nicely integrates R with its Power BI desktop. This is a test.</description>

      <description>A lot of times interested folks contact me with a question like this: ‘I want to be a data scientist; can you help?’
Well, I wish I could. The reality is, I won’t be able to unless I really understand what you want and why you want it.
Firstly because guiding someone is next to impossible in this time and era when everything is so convoluted. People come to learn with preconceived ideas and notions.</description>

      <description>If you are exploring the hot field of Data Science today, you probably know by now that there is no unique way to define data science. Everyone’s perspective comes from their respective backgrounds. Statisticians think they are data scientists while CS folks think they are.
I would not go into the debate.
Both have truth in their arguments as the typical problems they solve are quite different. There are some exceptions where their workflows overlap.</description>

      <description>I would like to share a few things with you from recent experience of my transition from academia to industry. Of course I have a lot more experience than a fresh graduate, but something I’ve experienced that many others may benefit from. I believe this will help you to think at least. I’ve written this with the candidates in the US job market in mind.
Firstly, I would say this– lies, damn lies, statistics, AND one-page resume.</description>

      <description>I was asked if we can do the test of equality of two population variances using Stata. Well, I did not have to do it myself ever, but yes, it is possible to do it. Here is an example. I’ve just made-up the data to show the procedures.
Suppose we have the following data where the variables may represent two independent samples taken from normally distributed populations. And we want to test if the population variances of the two populations are the same.</description>

      <description>This is yet another experiment to see how good is the approximation of binomial probability when we use Poisson and normal distributions for scenarios with large n, and p close to zero or one.
Consider a problem where the random variable \(X\) follows a binomial distribution with a known probability of success \(p\), and number of trials \(n\). If n becomes large, it may not be possible to calculate the probabilities by hand calculation or using a calculator.</description>
