      <description>Microsoft Power BI Desktop version nicely integrates with R. R is an open source software for statistical computing and graphics. R has become popular among the data scientists because of its powerful data analytics and visualization capabilities. Power BI is Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s flagship BI tool for creating dashboards and interactive reports. With R as a backend engine for Power BI Desktop, you can do many cool things, which can be categorized into three broad applications&amp;ndash;</description>

      <description>This is yet another experiment to see how good is the approximation of binomial probability when we use Poisson and normal distributions for scenarios with large n, and p close to zero or one.
Consider a problem where the random variable \(X\) follows a binomial distribution with a known probability of success \(p\), and number of trials \(n\). If n becomes large, it may not be possible to calculate the probabilities by hand calculation or using a calculator.</description>
