      <description>This site, deepLearner, is not about Deep Learning as we understand in the field of Data Science. Rather, the purpose here is to express deep learning in the sense of learning something at the core. In other words, learning and taking it from shallow to a deeper level of understanding.
We are all learners. Some of us are deep learner. That’s deepLearnR.
Of course learning the technologies, i.e., data science, in particular, will be a major focus of our articles.</description>

      <title>Power BI single R script for multiple data sets / tables</title>

      <description>Power BI is a great tool for creating interactive statistical tables with the aid of R. When using R as a data connector, you can use a single R script to have multiple data frames loaded into Power BI.
Often, as we are developing the report, you will add or remove tables in the single R script. It is convenient to have all the codes in a single table since most of the data frames are derived from the main data set.</description>

      <description>Microsoft Power BI Desktop version nicely integrates with R. R is an open source software for statistical computing and graphics. R has become popular among the data scientists because of its powerful data analytics and visualization capabilities. Power BI is Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s flagship BI tool for creating dashboards and interactive reports. With R as a backend engine for Power BI Desktop, you can do many cool things, which can be categorized into three broad applications&amp;ndash;</description>

      <description>Github needs no introduction. If you are unfamiliar with git, its a version control system for tracking changes in computer (programming) codes. &amp;ldquo;GitHub Inc. is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.&amp;rdquo;1
Copying a remote repository to local To bring a remote repository to your local host (computer where you are working), use the git clone command.</description>

      <description>Today is 7/26
This is test post to check if Python code works
library(reticulate) ## Warning: package &amp;#39;reticulate&amp;#39; was built under R version 3.4.4 import numpy as np x = [1, 2, 3] print(x) ## [1, 2, 3] y = np.mean(x) \(\bar{x}\) is the average, which is defined as \[ \bar{x} = \frac{\sum x}{n} \]
So what is the aveage of y? It is 2.
x = c(1:5) The value of x is R session is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</description>

      <description>A lot of times interested folks contact me with a question like this: ‘I want to be a data scientist; can you help?’
Well, I wish I could. The reality is, I won’t be able to unless I really understand what you want and why you want it.
Firstly because guiding someone is next to impossible in this time and era when everything is so convoluted. People come to learn with preconceived ideas and notions.</description>

      <description>If you are exploring the hot field of Data Science today, you probably know by now that there is no unique way to define data science. Everyone’s perspective comes from their respective backgrounds. Statisticians think they are data scientists while CS folks think they are.
I would not go into the debate.
Both have truth in their arguments as the typical problems they solve are quite different. There are some exceptions where their workflows overlap.</description>

      <description>I would like to share a few things with you from recent experience of my transition from academia to industry. Of course I have a lot more experience than a fresh graduate, but something I’ve experienced that many others may benefit from. I believe this will help you to think at least. I’ve written this with the candidates in the US job market in mind.
Firstly, I would say this– lies, damn lies, statistics, AND one-page resume.</description>

      <description>সবকিছুই এখন দ্রুত চলছে — প্রযুক্তির উন্নয়ন হচ্ছে দ্রুত, সামাজিক পরিবর্তন হচ্ছে অনেকটা চোখের সামনেই, বাড়ছে মানুষ, আর সেইসাথে বাড়ছে ডেটা!
সময়ের প্রয়োজনে গবেষণা এখন হয়ে উঠেছে কোলাবরেটিভ বা সহযোগিতামূলক। এতে সুবিধা অনেক। একসাথে অনেক ফিল্ডের এক্সপার্টরা কাজ করছে যার ফলে প্রোডাক্টিভিটি বেড়েছে। অর্থাৎ অল্প সময়ে দ্রুত প্রোডাক্ট (রিসার্চ পেপার) বের করা সম্ভব হচ্ছে। নব্বইয়ের দশক থেকে শুরু করে তার পরবর্তী সময়কালে কোলাবরেটিভ কাজের সুযোগ ও আগ্রহ দুইই বেড়েছে।</description>

      <description>I was asked if we can do the test of equality of two population variances using Stata. Well, I did not have to do it myself ever, but yes, it is possible to do it. Here is an example. I’ve just made-up the data to show the procedures.
Suppose we have the following data where the variables may represent two independent samples taken from normally distributed populations. And we want to test if the population variances of the two populations are the same.</description>

      <description>This is yet another experiment to see how good is the approximation of binomial probability when we use Poisson and normal distributions for scenarios with large n, and p close to zero or one.
Consider a problem where the random variable \(X\) follows a binomial distribution with a known probability of success \(p\), and number of trials \(n\). If n becomes large, it may not be possible to calculate the probabilities by hand calculation or using a calculator.</description>
