<p>This is yet another experiment to see how good is the approximation of binomial probability when we use Poisson and normal distributions for scenarios with large n, and p close to zero or one.</p>
<p>Consider a problem where the random variable <span class="math display">\[X\]</span> follows a binomial distribution with a known probability of success <span class="math display">\[p\]</span>, and number of trials <span class="math display">\[n\]</span>. If n becomes large, it may not be possible to calculate the probabilities by hand calculation or using a calculator.</p>
<p>We can approximate the binomial distribution with a normal distribution or a Poisson distribution.</p>
<div id="an-example" class="section level1">
<h1>An example</h1>
<p>The probability that a person will wwwelop an infection even after taking a vaccine that was supposed to prevent the infection is 0.03. In a random sample of 200 people in a community who got the vaccine, what is the probability that six or fewer people will be infected?</p>
<div id="solution" class="section level2">
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Let <span class="math display">\[X\]</span> denote the number of persons getting infected. Clearly, <span class="math display">\[X\]</span> follows a binomial probability distribution with <span class="math display">\[n=200\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[p = 0.03\]</span>. The exact probability of having six or fewer people getting infected is</p>
<p>\[ P(X 6) = _{k=0}^{6}  p^k q^{200-k}]\</p>
