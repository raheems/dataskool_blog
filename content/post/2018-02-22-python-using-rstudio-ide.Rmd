Today is 7/26

This is test post to check if Python code works

```{r}
library(reticulate)
```


```{python}
import numpy as np
x = [1, 2, 3]
print(x)
y = np.mean(x)
```

$\bar{x}$ is the average, which is defined as 
\[
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x}{n}
\]

So what is the aveage of ```y```? It is ```r py$y```.

```{r}
x = c(1:5)
```

The value of x is R session is ```r x```.

More text is to be added.


# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
```
```

# Testing LaTeX

This is an inline test for math content in markdown $\bar{x}$. And this is a mathe block, defining the average--
\[
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x}{n}
\]

And some more complicated formula

\[
y = x_1 \beta_1 + x_2 \beta_2 + \epsilon
\]
is the multiple linear regression model with two covariates $x_1$ and $x_2$.


```md
When \\( a \ne 0 \\), there are two solutions to

$$ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $$

and they are:

\\[ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} \\]
```
