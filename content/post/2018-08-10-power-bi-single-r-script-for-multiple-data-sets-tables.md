Power BI is a great tool for creating interactive statistical tables with the aid of R. When using R as a data connector, you can use a single R script to have multiple data frames loaded into Power BI. 

Often, as we are developing the report, you will add or remove tables in the single R script. It is convenient to have all the codes in a single table since most of the data frames are derived from the main data set.
